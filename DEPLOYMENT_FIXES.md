```

### Frontend (Netlify)
```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain.onrender.com
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Push changes to your repository
2. Ensure environment variables are set in Render dashboard
3. Run deployment check: `npm run deploy-check`
4. Monitor deployment logs for any issues
5. Test API endpoints after deployment

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Netlify)
1. Push changes to your repository
2. Ensure environment variables are set in Netlify dashboard
3. Verify `_redirects` file is present in `frontend/public/`
4. Test the application after deployment
